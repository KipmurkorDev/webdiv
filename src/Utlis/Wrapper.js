                        <p>Strategy is necessary but it is never sufficient for the demand, decisive action and speed are required to create profit by shortening product and business model life cycles.
                            Our sprint-based approach leads us to create the MVP with a strategy that is faster to market in the minimum time frame.
                            The Test and Learn approach allows us to test the system from the beginning and learn about it by feedback and usability making the product more efficient.
